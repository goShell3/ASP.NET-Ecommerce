In a typical Ecommerce application using Clean Architecture, the **Domain Layer** and **Application Layer** are structured to separate business logic from application-specific details. Here’s a suggested folder structure for each layer, including an explanation of each folder's purpose. 

---

### Domain Layer Folder Structure

The **Domain Layer** defines core business entities, value objects, aggregates, interfaces, and domain events. It should be isolated from application or infrastructure concerns.

```
Ecommerce.Domain
│
├── Common                  // Contains common base classes and abstractions
│   ├── Models              // Base classes for Entities, ValueObjects, AggregateRoot
│   │   ├── Entity.cs
│   │   ├── AggregateRoot.cs
│   │   └── ValueObject.cs
│   └── Interfaces          // Domain-specific interfaces for repository patterns
│       └── IRepository.cs
│
├── Entities                // Business entities (Product, Order, Customer, etc.)
│   ├── Product.cs
│   ├── Order.cs
│   └── Customer.cs
│
├── ValueObjects            // Value objects (Price, Address, etc.)
│   ├── Price.cs
│   └── Address.cs
│
├── Aggregates              // Aggregate root classes managing entity boundaries
│   └── OrderAggregate.cs   // Order aggregate with Order and OrderItem entities
│
├── Events                  // Domain events for business logic notifications
│   ├── OrderCreatedEvent.cs
│   └── PaymentProcessedEvent.cs
│
└── Exceptions              // Custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
    ├── ProductNotFoundException.cs
    └── InsufficientStockException.cs
```

#### Explanation of Key Folders:

- **Common**: Contains base classes and abstractions, including `Entity`, `AggregateRoot`, and `ValueObject`. These foundational components enforce the structure of domain objects.
- **Entities**: Holds primary business entities like `Product`, `Order`, and `Customer`. Each entity represents a core concept of the domain.
- **ValueObjects**: Contains immutable value objects, such as `Price` and `Address`, which are defined by their values rather than identities.
- **Aggregates**: Groups related entities under aggregate roots, ensuring boundaries within the domain (e.g., `OrderAggregate` containing `Order` and `OrderItem`).
- **Events**: Defines domain events, which capture significant occurrences within the business domain (e.g., `OrderCreatedEvent`).
- **Exceptions**: Holds custom exceptions specific to the domain, allowing the domain layer to handle business-specific errors (e.g., `ProductNotFoundException`).

### Application Layer Folder Structure

The **Application Layer** contains logic for coordinating domain models, processing data, and implementing use cases. It’s generally organized to ensure reusability and clear boundaries between different application concerns.

```
Ecommerce.Application
│
├── Interfaces              // Application-level interfaces for dependency injection
│   ├── IProductService.cs
│   ├── IOrderService.cs
│   └── IPaymentService.cs
│
├── Services                // Application services implementing use cases
│   ├── ProductService.cs
│   ├── OrderService.cs
│   └── PaymentService.cs
│
├── DTOs                    // Data transfer objects for external interaction
│   ├── ProductDto.cs
│   ├── OrderDto.cs
│   └── CustomerDto.cs
│
├── Commands                // CQRS command definitions for write operations
│   ├── CreateOrderCommand.cs
│   └── UpdateProductStockCommand.cs
│
├── Queries                 // CQRS query definitions for read operations
│   ├── GetProductByIdQuery.cs
│   └── GetCustomerOrdersQuery.cs
│
├── Handlers                // Handlers for processing commands and queries
│   ├── CreateOrderHandler.cs
│   ├── GetProductByIdHandler.cs
│   └── UpdateProductStockHandler.cs
│
├── Mappings                // Mapping profiles for DTO to domain conversion
│   └── MappingProfile.cs
│
└── Exceptions              // Application-specific exceptions
    ├── InvalidOrderException.cs
    └── PaymentFailedException.cs
```

#### Explanation of Key Folders:

- **Interfaces**: Defines interfaces for services within the application layer, enabling dependency injection and separation of concerns (e.g., `IProductService`, `IOrderService`).
- **Services**: Implements application services containing business use cases. These services interact with the domain layer and manage use-case-specific logic (e.g., `ProductService` for product management).
- **DTOs**: Contains data transfer objects (DTOs) for transferring data to and from the presentation layer, keeping the domain model isolated.
- **Commands & Queries**: Implements CQRS principles by defining commands for write operations and queries for read operations. This keeps read and write concerns separate.
- **Handlers**: Handlers process commands and queries, orchestrating operations within use cases.
- **Mappings**: Includes AutoMapper profiles or similar mapping utilities for converting between domain models and DTOs.
- **Exceptions**: Custom exceptions specific to the application layer, providing clear, context-specific error handling.

### Key Points

- **Domain Layer** focuses on business logic, with no dependencies on other layers.
- **Application Layer** implements use cases and coordinates between the presentation and domain layers.
- **CQRS (Commands and Queries)** in the Application Layer allows for clear separation between read and write operations, enabling more scalability and maintainability.
  
This structure promotes maintainability, testability, and clear boundaries between business logic and application behavior, aligning with Clean Architecture principles.
